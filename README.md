This is a Flask-based web backend that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms. It supports:

- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next)
- Round Robin
- Priority Scheduling
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- Memory Allocation (First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit)
- Banker's Algorithm (for deadlock safety check)

 Features

- REST API for simulating scheduling algorithms.
- Easy integration with frontends (HTML/JS or React).
- Vercel-compatible configuration for deployment.
